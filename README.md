# Future Sales

This challenge serves as final project for the "How to win a data science competition" Coursera course.

In this competition we will work with a challenging time-series dataset consisting of daily sales data, kindly provided by one of the largest Russian software firms - 1C Company.

We will predict total sales for every product and store in the next month. By solving this competition you will be able to apply and enhance your data science skills.
